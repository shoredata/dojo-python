Assignment: Random Word Generator

<h1>RANDOM WORD [ {{request.session.unique_id}} ]</h1>
<h2>Attempt # [ {{request.session.counter}} ]</h2>

<ul>
    <head>Objectives:</head>
    <li>Practice setting up a Django project</li>
    <li>Familiarity with passing data to a template</li>
    <li>Familiarity with using Django session</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <head>Create a new Django app called 'random_word'.</head>
    <li>Your template will show a random word with 14 characters in length.</li>
    <li>The first time you use this app, it should say 'attempt #1'. </li>
    <li>Each time you generate a new random keyword it should increment the attempt figure. </li>
    <li>The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce your use of session. </li>
    <li>Don't spend too much time on the random word generator, it's okay if your random word is not a real word.</li>
    <li>Also when an http request is sent to, say, localhost:8000/random_word/reset, have it reset the counter for the attempt and redirect back to localhost:8000/random_word.</li>
</ol>

Hint for generating a random word: See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25943850/django-package-to-generate-random-alphanumeric-string

There are many ways you could create a random string, but one way you could do this is by importing get_random_string from django.utils.crypto (remember that you can import other libraries/modules in your views.py or any other python files) use get_random_string(length=14) to get a random string of length 14.  As the goal of this assignment is to really help you get familiar with creating a new app, setting up routing, views, templates, etc, we've given you some hints. :)
